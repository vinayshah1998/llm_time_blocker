        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>LLM Time Blocker</p>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <span class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 31, 2026</span>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how LLM Time Blocker ("we", "our", or "the Extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Chrome extension and related services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
        <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email address</strong> — provided directly or via Google OAuth sign-in.</li>
            <li><strong>Password</strong> — if you register with email and password (stored as a salted hash; we never store plain-text passwords).</li>
            <li><strong>Google account profile data</strong> — limited to your email address and name when you authenticate with Google OAuth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Browsing Data Stored Locally</h3>
        <p>The Extension stores the following data in your browser's local storage (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocked site list</strong> — the domains you have configured to block.</li>
            <li><strong>Approval records</strong> — timestamps recording when you were granted temporary access to a blocked site.</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule configuration</strong> — time windows during which blocking is active.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication tokens</strong> — JWT access and refresh tokens used to authenticate with our backend.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers except as described below.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Chat and LLM Interaction Data</h3>
        <p>When you interact with the LLM gatekeeper to request access to a blocked site, the messages you type are sent to our backend server, which forwards them to a third-party LLM provider (Anthropic's Claude API) for processing. We may retain conversation logs for abuse prevention and service improvement.</p>

        <h3>1.4 Payment Information</h3>
        <p>Subscription payments are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>. We do not directly collect or store your credit card number or banking details. Stripe handles all payment data in accordance with PCI-DSS standards. We receive and store only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stripe customer and subscription identifiers.</li>
            <li>Subscription status and billing period information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.5 Technical and Usage Data</h3>
        <p>Our backend server may automatically collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address and request metadata (for rate limiting and security).</li>
            <li>Timestamps of API requests.</li>
            <li>Error logs for debugging purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide and maintain the service</strong> — authenticate your account, manage subscriptions, and process LLM requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Process payments</strong> — manage your subscription through Stripe.</li>
            <li><strong>Prevent abuse</strong> — detect and prevent misuse of the LLM gatekeeper feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve the service</strong> — analyze usage patterns in aggregate to enhance functionality and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate with you</strong> — send transactional emails related to your account or subscription.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We share your data only with the following third-party services, and only to the extent necessary to provide the Extension's functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anthropic (Claude API)</strong> — receives chat messages you send to the LLM gatekeeper. Subject to <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — processes subscription payments. Subject to <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Google</strong> — facilitates OAuth authentication. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Railway</strong> — hosts our backend infrastructure. Subject to <a href="https://railway.app/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railway's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account data</strong> is retained for as long as your account is active. You may request deletion at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>LLM conversation logs</strong> may be retained for up to 90 days for abuse prevention.</li>
            <li><strong>Local browser data</strong> is retained until you uninstall the Extension or clear it manually.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment records</strong> are retained as required by applicable tax and financial regulations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted data transmission over HTTPS/TLS.</li>
            <li>Hashed and salted password storage.</li>
            <li>Short-lived JWT access tokens (15 minutes) with secure refresh token rotation.</li>
            <li>Server-side rate limiting and input validation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Chrome Extension Permissions</h2>
        <p>The Extension requests the following browser permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>webNavigation</strong> — to detect when you navigate to a blocked website.</li>
            <li><strong>storage</strong> — to store your blocked site list, approval records, and authentication tokens locally.</li>
            <li><strong>tabs</strong> — to redirect blocked navigations to the gatekeeper page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are used solely to deliver the Extension's core blocking functionality. We do not collect or transmit your general browsing history.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your account and associated data.</li>
            <li>Export your data in a portable format.</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent for data processing where applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the email address listed below.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
