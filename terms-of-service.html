        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>LLM Time Blocker</p>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <span class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 31, 2026</span>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the LLM Time Blocker Chrome extension and related services ("Service"). By installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>LLM Time Blocker is a Chrome browser extension that blocks access to user-configured websites and requires users to engage with an AI-powered gatekeeper (large language model) to obtain temporary access. The Service includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Chrome extension that intercepts navigation to blocked websites.</li>
            <li>An LLM-based chat interface for requesting access to blocked sites.</li>
            <li>A backend service for authentication, subscription management, and LLM request processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To use the Service, you must create an account using either an email address and password or Google OAuth authentication. You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate and complete registration information.</li>
            <li>Maintain the security of your account credentials.</li>
            <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
            <li>Accept responsibility for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to create an account and use the Service.</p>

        <h2>3. Subscription and Payment</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Pricing</h3>
        <p>The Service is offered as a paid subscription at <strong>$5.00 per month</strong>. New users receive a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> before billing begins.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Billing</h3>
        <p>Payments are processed by Stripe. By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring monthly basis. You are responsible for keeping your payment information current.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Cancellation</h3>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time. Upon cancellation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You will retain access to the Service until the end of your current billing period.</li>
            <li>No further charges will be made after cancellation.</li>
            <li>No partial refunds are provided for unused portions of a billing period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. Contact us within 7 days of a charge if you believe it was made in error.</p>

        <h3>3.5 Price Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify pricing with at least 30 days' notice. Continued use of the Service after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempt to bypass, disable, or circumvent the website blocking or LLM gatekeeper functionality through technical means (e.g., injecting scripts, modifying extension files, using automated tools).</li>
            <li>Use the LLM chat interface to generate harmful, abusive, illegal, or offensive content.</li>
            <li>Share, resell, or redistribute your account access.</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the backend services.</li>
            <li>Overload, disrupt, or abuse the Service infrastructure (e.g., excessive API calls, denial-of-service attacks).</li>
            <li>Use the Service for any purpose that violates applicable law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. LLM Interactions</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Nature of LLM Responses</h3>
        <p>The LLM gatekeeper is an AI system. Its responses are generated algorithmically and do not constitute advice, endorsement, or human judgment. Access decisions made by the LLM are part of the productivity tool functionality and are not guaranteed to be consistent.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Content You Submit</h3>
        <p>You retain ownership of the messages you send to the LLM gatekeeper. By using the Service, you grant us a limited license to process and transmit your messages to our third-party LLM provider (Anthropic) solely for the purpose of generating responses.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Anti-Cheat Measures</h3>
        <p>The Service includes measures to ensure genuine interaction with the LLM (e.g., paste restrictions in the chat interface). Attempting to circumvent these measures is a violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Service, including its code, design, branding, and documentation, is the intellectual property of LLM Time Blocker and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, logos, or brand assets.</p>
        <p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Extension for its intended purpose, subject to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using the Service, you consent to the data practices described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Service relies on third-party providers including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> — for LLM processing (Claude API).</li>
            <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — for payment processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Google</strong> — for OAuth authentication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective terms and policies. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or conduct of third-party services.</p>

        <h2>9. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>We strive to maintain reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free availability. The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to:</p>

            <li>Third-party service outages (e.g., Anthropic API, Stripe).</li>
            <li>Circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are not liable for any loss or inconvenience resulting from service unavailability.</p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
        <p>We do not warrant that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Service will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</li>
            <li>The Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</li>
            <li>The LLM gatekeeper will behave consistently or make "correct" access decisions.</li>
            <li>The blocking functionality will be impossible to circumvent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LLM TIME BLOCKER, ITS DEVELOPERS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM:</p>

        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless LLM Time Blocker and its developers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>13. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause, including for violation of these Terms. Upon termination:</p>
        <ul>

We will notify you of material changes by updating the effective date and, where feasible, providing notice through the Extension or email.
